==========

A brainwallet for Bitcoins, served as a self-contained HTML page with 
embedded JS and CSS.

Input keys are salted and stretched with a combination of
Scrypt (http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html) and 
PBKF2 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2).

You are encouraged to download this page and run it on an airgapped machine.

Donations to Bitaddress.org, who packaged a lot of the code up and
inspired us to make this product: 1NiNja1bUmhSoTXozBRBEtR8LeF9TGbZBN

  - Fix a broken link on the main page (was supposed to link here)
  - Upgrade Triplesec to work even if we can find a native CSPRNG, as long
    as we don't need a CSPRNG for what we're doing (as is the case here).
